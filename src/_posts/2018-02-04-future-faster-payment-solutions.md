In this article, we'll be looking at building a decentralised exchange based on the **ERC-20** and API standards for tokens within smart contracts as part of the Ethereum blockchain technology.

# EXTC Network

EXTC Network will become a new a decentralised exchange that allows delivery of financial services via a distributed ledger, self-executing smart contracts, and cryptocurrency.

## Create a standard for faster payment and high execution speed transactions

Four key elements that are guiding the design and development of our cryptographic currency roadmap are centered towards a **simple concept - the consistent global growth and need for**:

1. **Faster Payment Solutions**
2. **Distributed**, highly secured, trustworthy and resilient **networks** to support the concept,
3. Balancing the **transition between** new transaction **model** and legacy fiat one.
4. Accessible, **compliant services and regulated practices and commitments** over securities issuance

## Concept development

The name chosen for the token is **EXTC (Express Transaction Credits)**.

The vision is to achieve a brand new suite of financial services to facilitate and guarantee instant loans, lighting-fast payments and deposits between participants with enhanced transparency of transactions that offers users a well suited platform regardless of their financial standing.

All services will support traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and compliant tokens.

EXTC tokens will be built and issued as **EIP20** compliant for the Ethereum blockchains, underpinned by an incredibly secure and stable platform ensuring that each P2P node is reputable and not fraudulent.

### Building the Future

Four types of payments will be supported on the blockchain or distributed ledger:

* **Single Atomic Payments** - one-off payments
* **Time-based Payments** - one-off payments sent and received on a pre-arranged date
* **Real-time Standing Orders** - regular payment that pays a fixed amount to the same recipient on regular dates
* **Corporate Mass Payments** - bulk files of payment, that can be sent 24 hours a day, seven days a week
