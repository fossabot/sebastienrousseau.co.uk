##  Testing

To test the code simply run:

```bash
# Running tests:
$ npm run test || yarn test
```

## To deploy the contracts

```bash
truffle compile && truffle migrate â€”network ropsten
```

## Buying EXT tokens

```bash
$ truffle console
```

This will open the truffle console and we are going to use the web3.js API to interact with the deployed contract.
